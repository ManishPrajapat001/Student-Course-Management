# Student Course Management System

A Java-based application to manage students, courses, and enrollments.  
This project demonstrates the core functionalities of a simple student–course management system, including adding students, adding courses, enrolling students in courses, and listing student/course records.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This system is built using Java and follows object-oriented principles.  
It includes features such as:

- Add and manage **students**
- Add and manage **courses**
- Enroll students into courses
- Display lists of students and courses

The design uses inheritance for shared attributes (e.g., `Person → Student`, `Trainer`) and appropriate use of collections like `ArrayList` for dynamic data storage.
